# It's Lit!
## What is it?
"It's Lit" is a user-profile centered app that enables users to loan or receive books from other users in their area. The user's preferences are matched with books that other people are willing to lend (which we have stored in a database). The user can also choose to go to the results page and browse all the books in the database. If the user has books that they are willing to lend, they can enter the books' information for others to be able to find and borrow.

## How it works

Users first see a brief description of the app and how to use it.

![landing-top](./public/images/screenshots/landing-top.png "Landing Top")

They can either sign in or register on the landing page.

![landing-bottom](./public/images/screenshots/landing-bottom.png "Landing Bottom")

If they choose to register, they will enter their basic info,

![register-basics](./public/images/screenshots/register-basics.png "Basic Info")

enter whatever books they're willing to lend out,

![register-books](./public/images/screenshots/register-books.png "Register Books")

and choose which genres they're interested in.

![register-genres](./public/images/screenshots/register-genres.png "Register Genres")

After both registration or login, the users are led to their matches which are other people's books that are not currently lent out, based on their genre preferences.

Users can also see all of the books available on the All Books page,

![all-books](./public/images/screenshots/all-books.png "All Books")

or check a book they own in or out if they have lent it out to someone on the Profile page.

## Wireframing
The inital design process is relatively simple- users will be brought to a landing page that requires them to sign up for an account into order to receive content. After they enter books they may have, and the types of books they're interested in, results are shown in a gallery with a module pop-up for users to decide whether they want to "swipe right" on ones they like or "left" on ones they're not interested in.
